# Library Managment

## author: **Saifullah shahen**



**Library management is a very important system for a library. I developed a basic system that helps a medium type library. 
Feature:

 - You can create student, books, books authors and books categories
 - Same user cannot take same book again
 - after finished books availability, Editor cannot issue book to other.
 - User login automatically after registration.

Technology:
 - Django
 - VueJs
 - Bootstrap

This is very simple. You can develop by your own. Codes are maintainable and understandable. Thank you.
